Rent Me

Rent Me is an ecommerce platform that allows users to either rent out or rent products they may only need once. Users can create accounts and search for specific things to rent whether it be tools or some recreational equipment that they would otherwise have to purchase and keep indefinitely. It also allows users an opportunity to make good use of things they may have purchased in the past that may just be lying around your apartment collecting dust. Think of this as an Air BnB but for things you own.
